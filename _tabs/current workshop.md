 ***

The workshop aims to stimulate our research progress and communication. It is a perfect time for PhD students to know each otherâ€™s research interests. All PhD students (including MCom students) are required to attend the workshop. Basically, every presenter will be assigned 6 minutes (5 minutes speech plus 1 minute Q&A). The order of the presentations will be based on PhD seniority. Those who join our department earlier will present first.

 ***

The slides presented in the workshop should be standardized as follows.

Slide 1: cover page, i.e., title, supervisor(s), and your personal information;

Slide 2: what's your research question (one is enough as we only have 5 minutes to present);

Slide 3: why you choose this research question, i.e., the motivation from literature overview and financial data or own intuition;

Slide 4: how you do this topic, i.e., methodology and data;

Slide 5: preliminary/key results of your current research, i.e., one table or figure.

Slide 6: Thank You.
